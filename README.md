2D Procedurally Generating Terrain with chunk unloading, full instructions on my YT KobeDev

Just import this to test for yourself if you want to or you can copy and paste the scripts and follow along with the tutorial.
Credit to @SlothInTheHat for the Tilemap code but I have improved and revised some bugs that also adds a chunk unloader.

Free top down smooth player movement too included.
